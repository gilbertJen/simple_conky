# simple_conky

This is a configuration for a simple and clean conky. This config has a very small footprint but quickly shows processes, temp, CPU and RAM usage. Bars are used to graph CPU, RAM and drive storage.

This conky configuration was tested with variety wallpaper app on Fedora 36. The color choice, lavender, is visible on many different backgrounds. The conky window is transparent with no border. 

To use this conky config, copy .conkyrc to the Home directory and restart conky. Install the included font 'Jackinput' or use any monospaced font (change line 21).
